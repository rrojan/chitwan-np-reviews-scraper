I booked on the elephant ride through the jungle and the driver had a metal stick with a hook, he struck him hard on the skull throughout and I ended up having to speak out and tell him that was so cruel. He wasn't happy with me and when the tour ended and I got off I noticed that the elephant had bleeding behind his ears, If you are going here to experience getting close to these incredible animals then speak up."}, {"title": "Wonderful experience", "date": "Mar 2020", "content": "The Chitwan National Park offers a variety of flora and fauna. Do not miss the jeep safari and especially the elephant safari. We were lucky to see a few rhinos, Gharial crocodiles, peacock, wild bore, spotted deer, buck deer, and lots of amazing colourful birds. The elephant safari was a memory to be cherished for the rest of your life. It's adventurous and thrilling. The elephant bathing was a fun too. You are allowed to go round the buffer zone of the forest only."}, {"title": "Do not miss the Elephants", "date": "Mar 2020", "content": "We had a great time and saw so much wild life inclding wild Rhinos (11) and Wild Elephants and Crocodiles - Tons of amazing birds as well - Get a good guide - Our helped us find a sleeping Rhino  "}, {"title": "Big and Beautiful National Park", "date": "Nov 2019", "content": "The Chitwan National Park was established in 1973 to protect this natural habitat from poachers, which was running rampant prior to the creation of the Park.  This Park was also recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  The Park is large at about 360 square miles in size and is quite beautiful with lush vegitation and with a picturesque river that runs through the Park.Our small group tour had stayed at the nearby Temple Tiger Green Jungle Resort for two (2) nights, where we had two (2) half-day jeep excursions from the Resort to the Park covering the western-side on the first half-day trip and the eastern side on the second half-day excursion.  For our small tour group, the Resort had provided two (2) of their tour jeeps and certified Park tour guides for each jeep.The natural scenery of the Park was very nice and picturesque as our jeeps were traversing through the high grass, the tall trees and even across running streams.  We saw just enough wildlife to keep things interesting, but we were not able to see any tigers.  We did see many Water Buffaloes, Rhinos, Gharial crocodiles, Spotted Deers and many varieties of birds.  Our small group tour included a catered lunch on the river bank and under some large shade trees - quite nice!  After lunch, our tour also included small boat tours along the river through a section of the Park that is famous for having the Gharial crocodiles - exciting!Overall, our small tour group had a great time at the Chitwan National Park."}, {"title": "Nice", "date": "Mar 2020 \u2022 Couples", "content": "Had a safari in the national park. Was ok, seen some animals but not all but hey that is nature. The park itself is a nice place to visit. Do not expect too much , the better it is."}, {"title": "horrendous welfare of elephants.", "date": "Mar 2020", "content": "I have rated this park 2/5. the exceptional parts of the park include:1. plastic free policy and cleanliness 2. Jeep safari through conservation area wehre Hog, Barking, Spotted and Sambar deer were seen along with mum and baby rhino, wild boar, and a beautiful array of birdlife.However the animal cruelty towards the poor elephants has to stop, and it can only stop if tourist stop supporting it.I have emailed the park regarding my concerns as tourist, I would love to see the elephants in their natural environment roaming freely through the parks.The elephants walk the paths of the park (carrying sometimes 8 people), they limp, theyre skinny and they look utterly miserable. it was heart breaking to see. The elephants are chained up with shackles, and then tied very closely and tightly to poles.The elephants were observed to be housed isolated in individual sheds, not amongst their elephant family.We refused to ride them, we refused to see the breeding centre (the google reviews speak for themselves). I witnessed 1 elephant in the river with their handler, which i thought was nice. then I noticed it was just another form of enterainment to attract tourists. Such huge and beautiful animals forced to do as they are told with a hook dug into their skin behind their ear. I do recommend that you go to Chitwan, i recommend you go on both jeep safaris on offer and see the wildlife, as its beautiful.I also recommend that you do not support the elephant industry, and you do not support the abuse that these beautiul creatures endure."}, {"title": "I witnessed horrific abuse of elephants at this park", "date": "Jan 2020", "content": "TPlease do not patronize this park.  I arrived at the park to discover emaciated elephants at 6 am reporting for work.  They piled six tourists very large some obese onto the backs and they kicked and beat the elephants.  It was shocking and horrible.  Until this abuse reported by so many pf Tripadviosr members ends-this heinous abuse of a beautiful feeling species-this park should be boycotted.  I was horrified by what I saw kicking and beating the elephants when they were dropping form lack of food and water.  My fiance filmed the whole day I could not stay to watch it was horrible. We still have the footage we can upload here.  My fiance currently is working with a documentary news program to feature footage filmed at the park.  There is no respect for animals whatsoever.  This is not something political this is something we personally witnessed and could not in good conscience pay to enter the park while this horrific abuse of elephants is taking place. I personally filmed the elephants entering the park in rank and file at 5 am they left the park at 8pm that means they worked with six large and often obese tourists on their backs for 15 HOURS! They were not fed during this time as my fiance documented.  We believe that caring responsible tourists want to know what is going on at this park before paying to go there. We enjoyed the indigenous peacock dances in the Tharu village rather than enter the park after filming this disgrace! The Tharu are a lovely people friendly and beautiful and they gave me the rose after the peacock dance they picked me.  It is unbelievable how graceful they are and it is a guy and he selects a woman from the audience after he dances to present a rose to.  He dances like the peacock in a peacock costume because it is the male peacock who has the striking plumage the females are tan.  So coming to the area was not a complete loss I learned about Tharu culture and met many kind people."}, {"title": "Valuable Tips", "date": "Mar 2020 \u2022 Solo", "content": "Here's what everyone should know, and it seems to me that too few are told in time to prepare properly:First, mindset. The wildlife is not on the payroll, absolutely cannot be made to appear, and may never appear at all. None of this is anyone's fault, not least the guide's fault. Therefore, it is wise to have no expectations whatsoever, just go on a nature walk for 1, 2, or 3 days (2 is recommended) and be pleasantly surprised at whatever you see, and not upset about whatever you don't see. You are not paying to see animals. You are paying for trained guides to escort you through the national park to look for and hopefully spot animals. Second, some animals are much more likely to be seen than others. You will see crocodiles, monkeys, deer, and lots of birds....  even though from distances usually not worth photographing. Rhinos and Boars are possible. Tigers, leopards, elephants.....   well, good luck, and if you do see them, you are indeed lucky.Third, Ronaldo the bull elephant. He has killed over 15 people in the park so far. Ask your guide about that, and perhaps consider carefully if you really need to see a wild elephant that will kill you if he can, while you'll see lots of trained elephants on the roadway along the river in Sauraha. It's your call. Fourth, wear only dark clothing- dark green is best, but dark blue, brown, and black are ok, too. For your safety, do not wear red, yellow, or white. Also, do not wear any scents such as perfumes or deodorants. However, be mindful of mosquitoes at night if you stay in the village, and also around Sauraha. They are everywhere after dusk. Muscle balms like Golden Cup, Icy Hot, and Tiger Balm work best before and after. If you want to be lazy and travel lighter, just bring fresh underwear and socks, as you can easily get 2 days out of your clothes on a trek. If your clothes get wet, drape them over your back or bag while trekking. Wear light, strong shoes that can get muddy or wet without causing too much trouble. A good sun hat and a walking stick are an asset.  If you are anaphylactic, bring Benadryl or an injection kit. Fifth, bring a bit of instant coffee with you if you're staying overnight, as the village is not guaranteed to have any. I know it's awful, but the chances of real coffee happening are zero. Sixth, I recommend as guides:\u25cf Gopal at the Hotel Parkside in Sauraha\u25cf Bikal & Razu at the tour kiosk in The New Style Yellow Chilli restaurant along the riverside road in Sauraha.

Typically the elephants are kept in chains and most are painted colors.Understand also that economic and cultural factors are different here than even in Thailand.The Jeep 'safaris' are also misleading.The 'safari' is essentially a ride through the forest on a narrow dirt path.If any sort of animal does not come within a 5-7 meter radius of your vehicle the chances of seeing anything other birds, crocs & some monkeys is very low.The high brush & dense trees surrounding the path are not conducive to seeing wildlife as you would expect. Please also note that everyone, from guides to hotel & restaurant staff, we encountered in Chitwan (as in all of Nepal) has been extremely friendly & helpful.Perhaps TripAdvisor should consider changing their stock photo of Chitwan of a bikini-clad Western female atop an elephant with her guide.Or perhaps that is most appropriate.
